    You're one of the first people in The Netherlands to use CoronaMelder
</p>

Until September 1, you can only get notifications from people tested for coronavirus by the GGD in the IJsselland, Noord- and Oost-Gelderland, Gelderland-Midden, Gelderland-Zuid, Drenthe and Twente regions.

From September 1, anyone who's been tested by the GGD and found to have coronavirus can decide to warn others using CoronaMelder. As long as those people use the app too, of course. 

It's smart of you to have downloaded the app so quickly. This way, you'll immediately help to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
